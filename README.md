# Attitudes-On-Wealth
For this project, I designed a survey and distributed said survey to 308 respondents. This survey covers attitudes on wealth, taxes, and political ideology.
This survey was distributed using AWS. AWS is a platform that pays its users to take surveys based on their interests. I have attached the raw data file under 
"PLSC 498 Project_April 19, 2022_08.49.csv." Since this is the raw file, I decided to clean the data and remove the respondents that did not answer. I did not attach
this file specifically. 

I have also attached the data analysis code that analyzes the different groups and their opinions on wealth/poverty. I have attached my final paper that goes over
my findings more in detail. However, a main take away from my data analysis is:

The typical respondent was a male, aged 25+, made $50,0001-100,000, conservative, and a democrat. 

To statistically test my theory, I used a two-means statistical test. I found that there was no statistical significance between college/non college and their attitudes 
on wealth. College respondents did not have more "empathy" towards poverty than the typical non-college respondents. 

People who made $100,000 and up and people that made $25,000 and lower both agreed with the statement "Poor people face more obstacles than rich people" on an aggregate level
